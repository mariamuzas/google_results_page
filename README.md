Hello,

This is my first project with HTML and CSS, just a Google's result page. It has been a small challenge to practice some basics that I've learnt recently about HTML and CSS.

I'm sure that there are some major mistakes, so if anyone is reading this code I would really appreciate the things that are wrong, or just some little guidelines about it.

Thank you very much for reading, 

Maria
